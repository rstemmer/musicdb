                    <p>
                        MusicDB is a music manager, server and player that focus is on music, not the software itself. 
                        It manages music on a server following the concept 
                        <i>The Filesystem is Always Right; the Database is Just for Augmentation.</i>
                        So, the tidiness of you music is not just inside MusicDB but on all devices 
                        like your portable music-player or your car.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can stream your music by 
                        <a href="https://www.musicpd.org/" target="_blank">Music Playing Daemon (MPD)</a>.
                        This stream and can be received by all kind of players like 
                        iTunes, VLC or by 
                        <a href="https://icecast.org/" target="_blank">Icecast</a> to encrypt the stream 
                        and send it out into the internet.
                        So your music is <i>in the cloud</i> but your files stay at home.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The stream gets controlled by a WebUI that hides the uglyness of software behind a nice, 
                        music-oriented and music-presenting frontend. 
                        Your music gets presented and is not just a database entry in a boring list of artists and albums.
                    </p>

                                    The WebUI presents the music, mostly represented by their album artwork.
                                    Instead of most other music manager and player, the management part of the music is totally hidden.
                                    This UI is made to enjoy listening to music, not to work on managing it.
                                    It adopts it colors to the color theme of the album artwork and allows making excessive use of Unicode.

                                Beside the audio and artwork, lyrics are the third part of a music collection.
                                MusicDB comes with a simple lyrics management allowing you to annotate lyrics to songs.

                                The Album View show the current playing album or a selected album from the Artist List.
                                In this view, all songs of an album get presented.
                                Beside the song name, their mood flags are displayed.
                                The diamantes on the screenshot show that these songs are favorite songs.
                                Furthermore on the very right of each song entry, a "likes/dislikes-bar" is shown.
                                These information help choosing songs from albums you haven't listen to for a long time.

                                Right click on a song opens a control box similar to the HUD.
                                There you can set the genre of a song, change flags or direct listen to the song 
                                in your browser.

                                Album artwork is an important part of music.
                                So, the management does not only concentrates on the music but also on the artwork.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For each album are three colors defined that will be used for the whole WebUI.
                                So, the whole UIs style fits to the design of the album artwork.

                                MusicDB does not use playlists, it uses a queue.
                                Songs can be added at the end of the queue, or on top right after the current playing song.
                                The queue view also allows to remove songs from the queue or change their position
                                by moving them via drag 'n' drop.
                                When the queue runs empty, a pseudo random song gets added.
                                So, the music never stops playing and the is no repeating playlist annoying you.

                                While real randomness allows to play the same song of thousands several times in succession,
                                the configurable random song selector from MusicDB
                                does not add songs to the queue that are too short,

                                or when another song of the same album or artist was recently played.

                                        You can also add or remove the artwork from files, 
                                        or change the file name encoding in case you have to export it

                                        MusicDB comes with the capability to use a Convolutional Deep Neural Network 
                                        to classify (tag) your music.
                                        The AI can "listen" to a song and sets one or more genre tags for the song.
                                        This tag can be confirmed or rejected by the user when it gets displayed in the WebUI.
                                        On the screenshots above, you will notice those AI set tags by their "probability-bar"
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Because each music collection is different, there comes no pre-trained model.
                                        In case you do not want to spend the effort to train a model, the AI functionality
                                        can be ignored.
                                        The AI is disabled by default. <i>This is a Crazy-Nerd Feature</i>

                                        This does not sound relevant, but it is a very important featured.
                                        The whole server code is well documented including all interfaces.
                                        That makes it very easy to develop own frontends that fits perfect
                                        to your music listening behavior.
                                        And if there is a feature missing it is easy to add.
